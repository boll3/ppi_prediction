Dear Madam/Sir,\\

We would like to enquire about a potential publication in \textit{Nature Methods}.
We report a significant breakthrough in the computational prediction of protein-protein interactions.
Based on the random forest learning algorithm we are able to identify protein-pairs that are likely to bind from databases with a size of 27k sequences within the range of a minute with unprecedented accurracy.
We are pleased to offer \tool\ as an online tool to the scientific community.
The combination of its accurracy and its speed will enable \tool\ to make substantial contributions and to  elevate many scientific projects with insights into complex interaction networks of proteins. 

Thus we believe, that publication in Nature Methods is well justified and ideal in order to inform a large number of scientists about the service we provide.
Please find attached a brief graphical summary.
It contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item a one page summary
\item ROC curves, comparing \tool\ to other available tools
\item an illustration of the training procedure
\item an illustration of the workflow of the server
\item a sketch of interaction network analysis
\item a screenshot of the webform
\end{itemize}

Kind regards\\
